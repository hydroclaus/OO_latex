OO_latex
========

# Instructions:

- put the two files `OO_latex.scpt` and `create_latex_pdf.py` into `~/Library/Scripts/OmniOutliner`
- then you can access the script from the script icon in the menubar
- to call the script, I use QuickSilver, as described [here](http://www.macosxtips.co.uk/index_files/run-applescripts-with-keyboard-shortcuts.php)


# This script does:

- gets content of note of selected row
     this should be a latex - math command
- passes the string of this content to a python script
     that generates a pdf of the latex string
- pastes a pdf of your latex string at the end of the selected row (not the note, the note stays there, found to be useful for future reference)

# This script requires

- a valid pdflatex installation, which is in the PATH variable set in ~/.bash_profile
- python with packages sys, os, datetime, time
- [pdfcrop][pc]
- ghostscript (for Yosemite see [here][gs])

# Notes

- 20160616: the current version works with TexLive 2016; 
	- see related discussion on [apple.stackexchange][apple_se]; 
	- depending where `pdflatex` and `pdfcrop` are located, you might need to change things in `~/.bash_profile`
	- depending on where `pdfcrop` resides or where it looks for dependencies, you might have to adapt its options (f.ex. to point to `pdftex`)

# Thanks!
